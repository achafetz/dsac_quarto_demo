## Project Purpose

This website serves as a practical demonstration of **Quarto's capabilities** for data analysis and reporting, specifically tailored for analysts working with healthcare and government data.

By comparing two versions of the same Medicare enrollment analysis, you can see firsthand how Quarto's features enhance reproducibility, automation, and presentation quality.

### Why This Matters for CMS Analytics

Working with Medicare and Medicaid data requires:

-   **Reproducibility**: Auditable analysis processes
-   **Automation**: Regular reporting cycles (monthly, quarterly, annual)
-   **Transparency**: Stakeholders need to understand methodology
-   **Flexibility**: Multiple output formats for different audiences

Quarto addresses all these needs in a single, open-source framework.

## Data Source

All analyses use public **Medicare monthly enrollment data** from [Data.CMS.gov](https://data.cms.gov), the official open data portal for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

This real-world dataset demonstrates how Quarto handles:

-   Large government datasets
-   Time-series analysis
-   Geographic variations
-   Reproducible reporting requirements common in healthcare analytics

## Technical Implementation

### Quarto Components Used

#### 1. YAML Configuration
The YAML header controls document behavior and appearance:

-   **Dynamic date**: Automatically updates to the render date
-   **Dynamic subtitle**: Can pull from parameters or calculations
-   **Code rendering defaults**: Control whether code is shown or hidden by default
-   **Output formats**: HTML, PDF, Word, presentations, and more

#### 2. Code Chunks
Analyses are written in **R** (though Quarto supports Python, Julia, and Observable):

-    Execute data processing and visualization
-    Generate tables and statistics
-    Create interactive elements

#### 3. Markdown and Inline Code
Narrative text integrates seamlessly with code results:

-    Explain methodology and findings
-    Include inline calculations (e.g., "The enrollment increased by `r growth_rate`%")
-    Format professional reports

### Advanced Features Demonstrated

#### Code Folding
In the fancy demo, code is hidden by default but accessible via a "Show code" link in the upper right corner. This keeps the document clean for non-technical readers while maintaining full transparency.

**Implementation:**

```
yaml
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
```

#### Table of Contents

Automatic navigation based on document headers improves usability for longer reports.

**Implementation:**

```
format:
  html:
    toc: true
```

#### Custom CSS Styling

External CSS files allow consistent branding across multiple reports without cluttering your Quarto document.

**Implementation:**

```
format:
  html:
    css: styles.css
```

#### Parameterized Reports

The `params` feature in YAML enables template-based reporting:

**Implementation:**

```r
params:
  state: "California"
  year: 2024
```

These parameters can be referenced throughout the document and changed programmatically to generate reports for all states, years, or other dimensions automatically.

**Example** use case: Generate 50 state-specific reports with a single command:

```r
# R code to render for all states
states <- state.name
for (state in states) {
  quarto::quarto_render(
    "analysis.qmd",
    execute_params = list(state = state),
    output_file = paste0("report_", state, ".html")
  )
}
```
