We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they have discovered so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We developed our disclosure policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.\nSubmit a vulnerability: Vulnerability reports can be submitted through Bugcrowd. Reports may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.\nReview the HHS Disclosure Policy and websites in scope: https://www.hhs.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/index.html.\nThis policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities."

    "text": "Technical Implementation\n\nQuarto Components Used\n\n1. YAML Configuration\nThe YAML header controls document behavior and appearance:\n\nDynamic date: Automatically updates to the render date\nDynamic subtitle: Can pull from parameters or calculations\nCode rendering defaults: Control whether code is shown or hidden by default\nOutput formats: HTML, PDF, Word, presentations, and more\n\n\n\n2. Code Chunks\nAnalyses are written in R (though Quarto supports Python, Julia, and Observable):\n\nExecute data processing and visualization\nGenerate tables and statistics\nCreate interactive elements\n\n\n\n3. Markdown and Inline Code\nNarrative text integrates seamlessly with code results:\n\nExplain methodology and findings\nInclude inline calculations (e.g., “The enrollment increased by r growth_rate%”)\nFormat professional reports\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Features Demonstrated\n\nCode Folding\nIn the fancy demo, code is hidden by default but accessible via a “Show code” link in the upper right corner. This keeps the document clean for non-technical readers while maintaining full transparency.\nImplementation:\nyaml\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAutomatic navigation based on document headers improves usability for longer reports.\nImplementation:\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n\n\nCustom CSS Styling\nExternal CSS files allow consistent branding across multiple reports without cluttering your Quarto document.\nImplementation:\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles.css\n\n\nParameterized Reports\nThe params feature in YAML enables template-based reporting:\nImplementation:\nparams:\n  state: \"California\"\n  year: 2024\nThese parameters can be referenced throughout the document and changed programmatically to generate reports for all states, years, or other dimensions automatically.\nExample use case: Generate 50 state-specific reports with a single command:\n# R code to render for all states\nstates &lt;- state.name\nfor (state in states) {\n  quarto::quarto_render(\n    \"analysis.qmd\",\n    execute_params = list(state = state),\n    output_file = paste0(\"report_\", state, \".html\")\n  )\n}"
