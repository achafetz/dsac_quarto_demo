Code Chunks\nAnalyses are written in R (though Quarto supports Python, Julia, and Observable): - Execute data processing and visualization - Generate tables and statistics - Create interactive elements\n\n\n3. Markdown and Inline Code\nNarrative text integrates seamlessly with code results: - Explain methodology and findings - Include inline calculations (e.g., “The enrollment increased by r growth_rate%”) - Format professional reports\n\n\n\nAdvanced Features Demonstrated\n\nCode Folding\nIn the fancy demo, code is hidden by default but accessible via a “Show code” link in the upper right corner. This keeps the document clean for non-technical readers while maintaining full transparency.\nImplementation: ```yaml format: html: code-fold: true"
